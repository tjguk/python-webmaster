READ THIS!  (If you want help.)

webmaster@python.org received an e-mail from you, and this is an
automated response.  python.org is a site devoted to the free object-
oriented programming language called Python, operated by the
Python Software Foundation (PSF).

Please read this message carefully for pointers to help find answers to
your question.

Note while a group of volunteers have seen your message,
webmaster@python.org will probably *not* respond to you personally
unless your question concerns the workings of the python.org web
site or other administrative business.


Issues with the python.org website
==================================

Website maintenance and development is done using a github issue
tracker. Issues or problems with the site should be reported there:

    https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues

This is not the same as the Python language bugtracker, listed
below under Installation Issues.

Despite having the same domain suffix, the Python Package Index,
pypi.python.org, is actually a separately administered site.
Please visit that site to see links for where to report PyPi
issues, they are at the very top of the page:

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi

The Python Job Board is also separately administered:

    https://www.python.org/jobs (mail jobs@python.org for issues)


User-Driven Site Updates
========================

The principal value of the Foundation's work is in enabling communities,
and individual Python users, to share their knowledge. The Python Wiki

    https://wiki.python.org/moin

is therefore editable by users. To discourage huge amounts of spam that
nobody needs to see we have an fairly informal approval process that
basically consists of persuading someone who might, loosely, be termed
as "in charge" that you plan to make positive contributions. If you
haven't already, please mail www-pydotorg@python.org for permission,
with a brief outline of your proposals (include your wiki account
name).

Should you be asking yourself whether you can join the international Python
community we like to think the answer is here:

    https://www.python.org/psf/diversity


Legal Inquiries
===============

The Python Software Foundation's General Counsel can be reached via
legal@python.org. Please send all legal inquiries there. Please
try other methods first: the Python license has a FAQ:

    https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonSoftwareFoundationLicenseFaq

For claims regarding packages listed on PyPi, please contact
the PyPi administrators first.


Installation Issues
===================

If you are having an installation problem, you are probably not
the first one with that issue.  Please make sure you have read
all of the documentation on the downloads page, sometimes you have
to hunt around a bit to find all of the information.  The download
page attempts to auto-detect your system but there is a selection
to show all of the available downloads if it is not suggesting the
version you want.  If you really think you have hit a bug, please
check in the Python bugtracker to see if it is mentioned there:

    https://bugs.python.org/

The FAQ may have useful information for installation and learning:

    https://docs.python.org/3/faq/index.html

If you have discovered Python installed on your computer and are wondering
how it got there (and if you can remove it), please see this web page:

    https://www.python.org/doc/faq/installed/


Learning Python
===============

If you are starting to learn Python and would like to get help for
beginners, try contacting the Tutor mailing list.  The volunteers
on Tutor help beginners learn how to use the Python programming language.
You can subscribe to the tutor list by visiting the following web
page:

    https://www.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor

You can find more information for new programmers at

    https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide

There are also a vast number of internet resources for learning
Python, but these sites are not endorsed by the Python Software
Foundation.


Help with Python Programming
============================

For general information on the Python programming language, please
visit the home page

    https://www.python.org/

and the documentation page

    https://www.python.org/doc/

For more information about Python help resources, visit

    https://www.python.org/about/help/

The Python Wiki contains a number of useful resources, among them:

    Editing Python       https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors

    Python-Friendly      https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonHosting
    Web Hosting

    Python Books         https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks

    Python Training      https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTraining


Advanced Questions
==================

If you are asking a question about Python programming, start with the
FAQ:

    https://www.python.org/doc/faq/

If that doesn't answer your question, send it to python-list@python.org
(python-list can also be accessed as the netnews group comp.lang.python)
or help@python.org.  python-list and c.l.py are preferred as the first
step in getting assistance, because many more people are likely to read
your message.

If you wish to send a message to python-list, you should subscribe
first, because many people will only post public responses (this
ensures that lurkers also get the information):

    https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list

help@python.org is a mailing list that reaches a number of volunteer
Python language experts dedicated to answering questions about the
Python programming language.  You do not need to subscribe to
help@python.org to ask a question of the helpers.  But please be as
clear as you can about the problem, including relevant details such as:

 - Precise error messages, including complete tracebacks
 - The hardware platform
 - The operating system (available in the Python sys module as
sys.platform)
 - The Python version (sys.version)
 - The Python search path (sys.path)


I Did Not Get My Confirmation Email After Creating an Account
=============================================================

The various spam protection mechanisms deployed by internet service
providers sometimes have a side effect of making it hard for email from
non-humans to get delivered.  The confirmation emails are system-generated
and sometimes get caught.  Check your spam box, or any other place your
ISP may have put blocked or quarantined mail.


Subscribing to / Unsubscribing from Mailing Lists
=================================================

The python.org webmasters cannot help you get on or off lists that
happen to be managed with the Mailman package.  Contact the
administrator of the particular list instead.  If you send email to
the list using an address like "foobar@somewhere.com", try addressing
your request to "foobar-request@somewhere.com" or
"foobar-owner@somewhere.com".

Note that all Mailman lists contain an URL at the bottom of each
message that takes you to a web page where you can unsubscribe from
the list.

You can also see a list of public mailing lists hosted by python.org at

    https://mail.python.org/

For information about the Mailman package, see

    https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/mailman.html


"The joy of coding Python should be in seeing short, concise, readable
classes that express a lot of action in a small amount of clear code
-- not in reams of trivial code that bores the reader to death."
